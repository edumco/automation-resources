Is a sеt of guidelines and a [[software framework]] to automate tеsts for softwarе applications.

These guidelines could include coding standards, test-data handling methods, object repositories, processes for storing test results, or information on how to access external resources.

Each programming language¹ and level of tests has its own Test Automation Framework².

## [[Java]]

² There are other frameworks **I don't know** enough to recommend.
