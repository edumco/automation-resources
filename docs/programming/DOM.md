The **Document Object Model** (_DOM_) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

It defines the logical structure of a document, treating it like a tree where each branching node represents individual [[elements]]. 

Programs can access the DOM to read and modify the document's structure, content, and style.
