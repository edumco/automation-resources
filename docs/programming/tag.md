Tags are the basic formatting tool used in HTML (hypertext markup language) and other markup languages, such as XML. For example, the <table> tag is used to insert a [table](https://techterms.com/definition/table) on a [webpage](https://techterms.com/definition/webpage). The data that should be inside the table follows the <table> tag, and the table is closed with a </table> tag.

If you want text to be **bold** in a block of text, you would use the bold tag.
