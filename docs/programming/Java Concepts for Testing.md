## General Java programming

1. **Classes and Objects**: Understanding how to create classes and instantiate objects is fundamental, as unit tests often instantiate objects from the class being tested.

2. **Methods**: Knowing how to define and call methods is essential, as tests will call the methods of the class under test.

3. **Constructors**: Know the use of constructors to create objects with specific states necessary for tests.

4. **Encapsulation**: Use getters and setters to access and modify object attributes.

5. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Understand how to create and use subclasses and overridden methods, useful for testing class hierarchies.

6. **Interfaces**: Know how to use interfaces and their implementations, especially when using mocks in tests.

7. **Collections (List, Set, Map)**: Use collections to store test data or expected results.

8. **Generics**: Use generic types to create typed collections and reusable methods.

9. **Exception Handling**: Know how to throw and catch exceptions, and verify that the correct exceptions are thrown in tests.

## Specific to Java 8

10. **Streams and Lambdas**: Use streams to manipulate collections and lambdas for concise and clear expressions.

## Specific to Test programming

11. **Annotations**: Understand the use of annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, etc.), especially when using JUnit 5.
