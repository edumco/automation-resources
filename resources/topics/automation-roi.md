# Automation ROI

## Tech stacks

Every technology requires a set of environments, tools and expertise that we call "Tech Stack". We can define the stacks by its characteristics:

- Program environment
  - Web
  - Mobile
  - Desktop
    ...
- Programing Language
  - Java
  - Python
  - NodeJS
    ...
- Frameworks used
  - Django
  - Flask
  - React
    ...

This characteristics also define what technologies will be used to test this application. So when we talk about teck stack we have to describe not only the tech stack for developing but the testing tech stack.

Before decide to automate the tests you have to define what will be tested and which of the tests can and will be automated. Some kinds of test are easy to automate and therefore good candidates on the other hand the most complicated to execute or the more repetitive tests are the ones with the best ROI.

### Test Level

- Unit test
- Component
- Integration

### Test type

  ...
